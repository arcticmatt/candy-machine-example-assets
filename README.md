# candy-machine-example-assets

The example assets provided in [the docs](https://docs.metaplex.com/create-candy/prepare-assets) are outdated and don't work.

Here are the main changes I made:

1. Added necessary fields to the metadata files
2. Increased the asset size (necessary because of [this issue](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/issues/638))
